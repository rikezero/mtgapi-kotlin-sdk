Kotlin SDK for using the magicthegathering.io APIs.

I've made this one since the other Kotlin SDK seems to not being maintained anymore and I decided to try and make a new one and adding UseCases and better suiting it to my tastes, feel free to use or fork it.

WIP - I'll be updating this in order to complete the development and finish all the setups and little details here and there.
