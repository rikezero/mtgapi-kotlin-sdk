# Kotlin SDK for using the magicthegathering.io APIs

I've made this one since the other Kotlin SDK seems to not be maintained anymore and I decided to try and make a new one, adding UseCases and better suiting it to my tastes. Feel free to use or fork it.

WIP - I'll be updating this in order to complete the development and finish all the setups and little details here and there.

## Version
Current SDK version: v1.0.0.22
